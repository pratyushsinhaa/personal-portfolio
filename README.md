personal portfolio website.


current plans and things i need to do before this works - 
    1. Take 1 or 2 cool ass pictures in the dark as intro to the websites, both black on white can colour grade later. 
    2. choose js lib and figure out what stack to use. (one that has pop and push haha)
    3. choose how to do css (daisy UI maybe?)
    4. find textual form of LateX resume and include it in one of the pages. 
    5. figure out hosting for the website.
